- read lat0, lon0 from colliders into floating point values (done)
- set home position (done)
- retrieve current global position (done)
- convert to current local position using global_to_local()
	- how to update self.local_position? update self._north and so on not update self.local_position
- convert start position to current position rather than map center (done)
- add diagonal motions with a cost of sqrt(2) to your A* implementation? (copy from planning)(done)
- prune path to minimize number of waypoints
- Medial-Axis (grid to graph)(sequently, prune_path must support graph)
	- find_start_goal in Medial-Axis (necessary solve the "out of bounds")

- add grid_goal param for mothion_planning
- send waypoints ???
- compute min/max (lat/lon) of grid
	- how to auto modify goal depend on the edge (solve the problem:out of bounds)
- auto return
